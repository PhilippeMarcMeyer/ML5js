Machine Learning with ml5.js library
This is a copy a the project made by Daniel Shiffman on youTube

It captures the computer camera and sent the images to a pre-trained image classifier model at http://image-net.org/
which returns a classification and a probability

the model is trained with animals and mundane objects like forks and cellulars
so the predictions can be funny !
